# Session Export - 2025-10-09

## Session Summary
**Duration:** Single task session
**Main Objective:** Document pending project tasks in TODO.md
**Status:** âœ… Completed

---

## Work Completed

### Created TODO.md
Generated comprehensive task documentation with 4 main priorities:

1. **ðŸ”´ Critical - Raspberry Pi Access Point Stability Issue**
   - Problem: Clients disconnect after ~2 seconds post-authentication
   - All scripts (script_3.sh through script_7.sh) fail to maintain stable connections
   - Requires investigation of DHCP, NetworkManager conflicts, power management

2. **ðŸŸ¡ Bug - Duplicate Browser Tabs on Startup**
   - Flask app opens 2 tabs to `/qr` endpoint instead of 1
   - Location: `app.py` - likely in `open_browser()` function

3. **ðŸ”µ Enhancement - Network Subnet Migration**
   - Change from `192.168.10.0/24` to `10.0.17.0/24`
   - Gateway/AP IP: `10.0.17.1`
   - DHCP range: `10.0.17.2-254`

4. **ðŸŸ¢ New Feature - Simple WiFi Management Script**
   - Interim solution while full AP script is postponed
   - Script to control: WiFi radio on/off, SSID broadcast show/hide
   - Proposed name: `scripts/manage_wifi.sh`

## Project State

### Git Status (at session start)
```
Current branch: master
Untracked files:
  .claude/
  CLAUDE.md
```

### Recent Commits
- `490a027` - Testing script number 7
- `87c722a` - Fixed country_code parsing with extra artifacts
- `22672b8` - New scripts for static access point conversion

### Files Modified This Session
- **Created:** `TODO.md` (root directory)

---

## Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
1. **Access Point Scripts Not Working**
   - Multiple iterations attempted (script_3 through script_7, simple_hotspot)
   - Connection drops after authentication
   - No stable solution yet found

2. **Browser Auto-Launch Bug**
   - Consistent duplication of tabs
   - Not yet investigated in code

### Pending Decisions
- Which approach to take for AP stability (NetworkManager vs dhcpcd vs systemd-networkd)
- Whether to implement interim WiFi management script first or continue debugging full AP solution
- Timeline for subnet migration (task #3)

### Key Project Info
- **Tech Stack:** Flask, watchdog, qrcode, hostapd, dnsmasq
- **Primary Use Case:** Event photo sharing via local WiFi network
- **Target Hardware:** Raspberry Pi
- **Network Mode:** Offline access point (no internet)

---

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Prioritize AP stability debugging** - This is the blocker for production use
   - Start with: `journalctl -u hostapd -u dnsmasq --since today`
   - Check: `/var/log/image-hotspot/hotspot.log`
   - Test power management: `iwconfig wlan0 power off`

2. **Quick win: Fix duplicate tabs bug** - Should be straightforward
   - Review `app.py` line by line for `webbrowser.open()` calls
   - Check threading logic in startup sequence

3. **Consider creating manage_wifi.sh** as interim solution
   - Allows basic WiFi control while debugging main AP issue
   - Low effort, immediate utility
